androstenetrione,Androstenetrione is a steroid. Despite serious safety concerns, it is used for improving athletic performance. Androstenetrione is promoted as an alternative to “prohormones” such as androstenedione. Marketers claim that androstenetrione increases the body's natural testosterone levels and therefore is free from the negative side effects of prohormones. There is no reliable evidence to back these claims. The body converts some of the male hormone testosterone to the female hormone estrogen. Androstenetrione blocks this conversion. Some people suggest that the body makes up for the falling estrogen level by making more testosterone. They further suggest that the higher levels of testosterone will improve athletic performance. Some people who sell androstenetrione say that it increases total testosterone by 188% and free testosterone by 226% over 3 weeks of use. But there is no scientifically reliable research in people that supports these claims.The body converts some of the male hormone testosterone to the female hormone estrogen.

arsenic,Arsenic is a trace element that naturally occurs in foods, such as rice. Organic arsenic is usually safe, but another form, inorganic arsenic, can be toxic. The role of arsenic in the body isn't well understood. Most adults probably eat about 12-50 mcg of arsenic every day from a usual diet. Some experts have suggested that an average adult should have 12-25 mcg daily. People use homeopathic preparations of arsenic for arsenic poisoning, COVID-19, seizures, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Homeopathic preparations are often so dilute that they contain little or no arsenic. Inorganic arsenic compounds, which are different than organic arsenic, are considered poisonous. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies inorganic arsenic as a known cancer-causing agent. The maximum amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water is 10 mcg per liter.,Uses & Effectiveness  ?  Effective for Cancer of the white blood cells (leukemia). A specific, prescription-only form of arsenic (arsenic trioxide, Trisenox) is given by IV for the treatment of a specific cancer of the white blood cells known as acute promyelocytic leukemia. This product can only be given by a healthcare provider. There is interest in using arsenic for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.,When taken by mouth: Organic arsenic is likely safe when eaten in normal food amounts. But inorganic arsenic, a different form of arsenic, is likely unsafe, especially when used long-term or in high doses. Taking 10 mcg/kg daily over time can cause arsenic poisoning. Higher doses can cause severe poisoning and death. Inorganic arsenic is classified as a cancer-causing agent in humans.
